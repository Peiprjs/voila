We believe these is the best variable we have available to determine the quality of sexual and reproductive healthcare, especially when it comes to sexually-transmitted diseases, as the parents can transfer HIV to their children, but only if they are HIV-Positive, therefore, not receiving antiretroviral treatment that would turn them HIV-Indetectable, and therefore HIV-Intransmittable (in the case of per-mille HIV/AIDS deaths of 0-4 year-olds); and a more robust healthcare system with good public conscientisation of the need for vaccinations (in the case of Hepatitis-B).\n",
        "\n",
        "We hypothesize that we will see some sort of negative correlation between expenditure and HIV/AIDS deaths in newborns and children, because with more healthcare spending will come more testing availability (we may see a small increase of **REPORTED** HIV/AIDS deaths in newborns as healthcare spending increases, due to the increased availability of testing), as well as better access to antiretrovirals, which can turn a previously HIV-positive into an HIV-indetectable, meaning that HIV can no longer be transmitted, yet still lays dormant in the patient's body. We also hypothesize that HIV/AIDS deaths in children aged 0-4 will decrease as years pass, but that healthcare spending will increase. We also hope to see a similar trend with Hepatitis-B vaccinations for 1-year-olds: increasing vaccinations as expenditure and years increase."
